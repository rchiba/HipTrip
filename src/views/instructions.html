<h1>HipTrip</h1>
<p>by Cort Werner and Ryo Chiba</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
When traveling, there are many existing services that provide reviews to help travelers decide where to dine, shop, or explore. However, distinguishing between places that tourists frequent and places that locals frequent is a challenge that continues to elude review services. In this paper, we present HipTrip, a novel system that utilizes geo-spatial data from various public sources to determine local “hotspots”, and finds highly rated points of interest within these areas. This application utilizes Semantic Web technology, named entity recognition, knowledge bases, and information extraction techniques to synthesize traveler behavior and points of interest in order to expose a visual layer of valuable data for travelers.
